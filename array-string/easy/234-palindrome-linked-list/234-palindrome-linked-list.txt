# 234 - Palindrome Linked List

## Difficulty: Easy - palindrome-linked-list

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true _if it is a_ _palindrome_ _or_false _otherwise_.

Example 1:

    Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
    Output: true

Example 2:

    Input: head = [1,2]
    Output: false

Constraints:

  * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
  * 0 <= Node.val <= 9

Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
