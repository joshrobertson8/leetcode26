# 326 - Power of Three

## Difficulty: Easy - power-of-three

Given an integer n, return _true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false_.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

Example 1:

    Input: n = 27
    Output: true
    Explanation: 27 = 33

Example 2:

    Input: n = 0
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0.

Example 3:

    Input: n = -1
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).

Constraints:

  * -231 <= n <= 231 - 1
